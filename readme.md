### Todo: 
 - How to use

 - setup github page for docs
 - ci/cd to push doc updates
 - tidy up docs more, make it really nice
 - tidy up readme to match the style of the docs.. 
 - try more apis to see if we can get something less verbose and nicer to use while remaining strongly typed
 - add dark mode toggle to docs (and default to OS default)
